This chat bot simulates responses from a child during an art therapy session. 
The responses are based on common emotional expressions and behaviors of children 
dealing with chronic conditions.

Example questions you can ask:
- How are you feeling today?
- What would you like to draw?
- Tell me about your drawing
- What colors make you happy?
- Do you want to try a different art activity?
